Makefile based LaTeX-Beamer template


## Description
This repository contains my latex beamer templates developed during my PhD
thesis and afterwards. The template comes with 2 themes and were inspired by

- https://github.com/FuzzyWuzzie/Beamer-Theme-Execushares
- https://github.com/kmaed/kmbeamer

## Installation
Just clone this repository and run `make` to build the example `main.pdf`

    git clone https://github.com/weinshec/latex-beamer.git
    cd latex-beamer
    make

The accompanying example file `main.tex` shows the basic usage and can be
modified right away to host your content.
