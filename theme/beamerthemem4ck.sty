% This style file is a combination of the four files required to create the FAA beamer theme.

%		1. Inner
%       2. Outer
%    	3. Color
%		4. Font

% You can directly use this file instead of the using the other theme file "beamerthemeFractal.sty" and calling the 4 styles in the TeX document.

% Assign colours to different constitutens of the presentation as per the requriements.

% This sets the colour of the title of the presentation and titles of all the slides in the presentation to black.
\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{fg = Ftitle}
\setbeamercolor{Title}{fg = myBlue}

% In case you choose to display the Table of Contents, or the Outline slide.
\setbeamercolor{section in toc}{fg = Ftitle}
\setbeamercolor{section in toc shaded}{fg = Ftitle} 

% The colour of all the items, subitems and and subsubitems are set to black.
\setbeamercolor{item}{fg = myBlue}
\setbeamercolor{subitem}{fg = myBlue}
\setbeamercolor{subsubitem}{fg = myBlue}

% This sets the color for each item heading of the description environment.
\setbeamercolor{description item}{fg = Descitem}

% NOTE: Setting the color black for all the items also sets in black for other environemnts like enumerate.

% We also need to fix the colours for captions for figures and tables.
\setbeamercolor{caption}{fg = Ftitle}
\setbeamercolor{caption name}{fg = Ftitle}

% In addition, we can also change the background colour of the slides depending on pur requirement.
% \setbeamercolor{background canvas}{bg = blue!5}
% We have commented out this command because this is just for illustrative purposes and has not been used to define the background colour of the slides.

% Now, there are three types of boxes in beamer: 
% 		1. Simple, or standard block, which can be invoked using definition or theorem
%		2. Alert block
%		3. Example block 
% We will customize all these blocks based on our requirements


% Standard block
%\setbeamercolor{block body}{bg = StdLight}
%\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = black, bg = Std}

\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = Descitem, bg = StdTitle!15!white}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%%		Outer theme
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%
% The outer theme takes the most amount of effort and time to customize. 


%%%%%%
% In the outer theme, we will try to do the following:
%	1. Change the headline by putting a logo and a horizontal line
%	2. Change the footline and include custom information depending on our requirements
%	3. Organize the presentation title and the frame titles


%%%%%%
% Let's start with the headline. The approach that we plan to take for the headline and footline is similar.
% We will first define a new command and then include the command in the \setbeamertemplate{} option. 
% I tried a couple of approaches that would make the method more simple but could not come up with one. In case you do find a more aesthetic approach, please do send it accross. The contact information is on the top of the page.



% First the horizontal line on the top portion of the slides
% Add a horizontal line that runs from left of the slide to the right, just below the logo.  
\newcommand{\LogoLine}{%
  \raisebox{-12mm}[0pt][0pt]{%
   	\begin{pgfpicture}{0mm}{0mm}{0mm}{0mm}
    	 \pgfsetlinewidth{0.28mm}
    	  \color{myBlue}
      	\pgfline{\pgfpoint{5mm}{1mm}}{\pgfpoint{11.6cm}{1mm}}
    \end{pgfpicture}
  }
}

\newcommand{\LowLine}{%
  \raisebox{3mm}[0pt][0pt]{%
   	\begin{pgfpicture}{0mm}{0mm}{0mm}{0mm}
    	 \pgfsetlinewidth{0.28mm}
    	  \color{myGray}
      	\pgfline{\pgfpoint{0mm}{1mm}}{\pgfpoint{12.8cm}{1mm}}
    \end{pgfpicture}
  }
}

% Include the line that we just created in the headline
\setbeamertemplate{headline}[text line]{\LogoLine}


% Now the logo. As it turns out. I could not include the logo in the headline. If I tried to, the headline kept shifting downwards.
% Acting a little smart and lazy, I just included the logo in the right sidebar and shifted it up. 
\setbeamertemplate{sidebar canvas right}{
	\vspace*{3pt}\hspace*{-80pt}%
		{\includegraphics[height=25pt]{JGU.pdf}}} 



%%%%%
% Now that we have changed the headline, we will need to orient the frame titles in a way that the come at the right stop just above the horizontal line.
\setbeamertemplate{frametitle}{
\vspace*{4mm}\hspace*{5mm}\insertframetitle}


%%%%%
% Like mentioned above, we will take a similar approach to customize the footline as well and inclued FAA in it.
\newcommand{\Ffootline}{%
  \color{myGray}
  	\insertauthor % The left end of the footline
  \hfill
	\inserttitle % The center
  \hfill
    \hspace*{15mm}
  	\insertframenumber/\inserttotalframenumber} % And the right end


\setbeamertemplate{footline}{%
  \usebeamerfont{structure}
  	\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\paperwidth,ht=2.25ex,dp=1ex]{title in head/foot}%
        \LowLine
    	\Tiny\hspace*{4mm} \Ffootline \hspace{4mm}
  	\end{beamercolorbox}}
  	
 
%%%%%%
% We will also remove the navigation symbols, which I personally don't find very useful
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}


%%%%%%
% Define custom commands for backupslides
\newcommand{\backupbegin}{
   \newcounter{lastframenumber}
   \setcounter{lastframenumber}{\value{framenumber}}
}
\newcommand{\backupend}{
   \addtocounter{lastframenumber}{-\value{framenumber}}
   \addtocounter{framenumber}{\value{lastframenumber}} 
}



%%%%%%
% Now the toughest part--at least for me--customizing the title page.
% Putting a logo on the title page and text beside it was quite a difficult task and to be fairly honest, my code is not effecient at all. At the very least, it is plain clumsy.
% Though it does solve the purpose (I hate to use this phrase) it is neither "neat" nor "cool".
% Anyway, let's see how we went about it.
% For the title page, we needed a logo on the left, a vertical separater line, and finally a place for the title, author, date etc. 



% First, let's create the line
\newcommand{\TitleLine}{%
  \raisebox{-12mm}[0pt][0pt]{%
   	\begin{pgfpicture}{0mm}{0mm}{0mm}{0mm}
    	 \pgfsetlinewidth{0.10mm}
    	  \color{gray}
      	\pgfline{\pgfpoint{55mm}{0mm}}{\pgfpoint{55mm}{50mm}}
    \end{pgfpicture}}}



% Now let's create commands for the title etc., that we can call later

% Title
\newcommand{\MyTitle}{%
 	\hspace*{60mm}\vspace{-25mm}
  			\centering \inserttitle}
  			
% Subtitle  			
\newcommand{\MySubTitle}{%
	\hspace*{60mm}\vspace{-25mm}
  		\centering	\footnotesize \textit{\insertsubtitle}}
  		
% Author   		
 \newcommand{\MyAuthor}{ 		
 	\hspace*{60mm}\vspace{-25mm}
		\centering \insertauthor}
		
% Institute		
 \newcommand{\MyInstitute}{ 		
 	\hspace*{60mm}\vspace{-25mm}
		\centering \footnotesize \textit{\insertinstitute}}

% Date			
 \newcommand{\MyDate}{		
  	\hspace*{60mm}\vspace{-25mm}
 		\centering	\insertdate}
  	
% We declare the image that will be used as the logo
\pgfdeclareimage[width = 0.2\paperwidth]{big}{JGU.pdf}

% This is quite a complicated command. We basically create a "beamercolorbox" for each field and invoke the commands that we had created earlier.
\setbeamertemplate{title page}{\TitleLine
	\hspace*{11mm}\vspace*{-60mm}
			\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=0.5\paperwidth,ht=0.13\paperwidth]{Title}
			\pgfuseimage{big}
		\end{beamercolorbox}
%		
		\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\paperwidth,ht=0.06\paperwidth]{Title}
		    \usebeamerfont{Title}%
   	 		\MyTitle	
		\end{beamercolorbox}
%
   		\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\paperwidth,ht=0.03\paperwidth]{Title}
		    \usebeamerfont{Title}%
   	 		\MySubTitle	
 		\end{beamercolorbox}
%
 		\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\paperwidth,ht=0.06\paperwidth]{Titlepage}
    		\usebeamerfont{Titlepage}%
   			 \MyAuthor	
  		\end{beamercolorbox}
%
   		\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\paperwidth,ht=0.03\paperwidth]{Titlepage}
		    \usebeamerfont{head/foot}%
   	 		\MyInstitute
		\end{beamercolorbox}
% 
   		\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\paperwidth,ht=0.07\paperwidth]{Titlepage}
		    \usebeamerfont{Titlepage}%
		   	 \MyDate
